9. You can now edit the names, title, email address to your own like you would on a word document. The styling and formatting should remain the same. 
10. Below the editing box, you are presented with 2 options regarding when you would like your signature to appear. Please select your **proof** signature for whichever default options you prefer. The first adds the signature to any new E-Mail created; the latter adds it to any replies to an E-Mail thread.
12. Check the box next to **Insert signature before quoted text in replies and remove the “–” line that precedes it.**
13. Save your changes by scrolling all the way down in the Settings and clicking **Save Changes**.
14. When sending out an email, Gmail lets you select which signature. Select the above signature as default and all your emails will have the same signature.
