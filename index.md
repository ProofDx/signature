12. Check the box next to **Insert signature before quoted text in replies and remove the “–” line that precedes it.**
13. Save your changes by scrolling all the way down in the Settings and clicking **Save Changes**.
14. When sending out an email, Gmail lets you select which signature. Select the above signature as default and all your emails will have the same signature.
